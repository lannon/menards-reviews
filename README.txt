Welcome to Seth Everhart's BigGreen Reviews.

Why? Menards does not have user reviews on their site and it drives me nuts. I can't be the only one. 

Notes: 

This is a page I will eventually deploy and the scope far exceeds the requirements for completion of the 
first section of CL. For the first portion of front-end, I will focus on the homepage and a few other 
sections for testing purposes and build out more of the site as i progress through CL classes. 

* Functioning links on Tools by Type page limited to Power Saws, Power Tool Combo Kits and Routers for initial project.
